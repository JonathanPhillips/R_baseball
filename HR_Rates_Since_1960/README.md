- The visual shows HR rate for each year since 1960.
#### Notes

Using the Lahman dataset in RStudio, this graph shows yearly HR rates.  Knowing that the “steroid era” is understood to be between 1990-2000, you can see that increase in the chart and then a slight decline afterwards.  The interesting point is the huge increase from 2010-2020. The question now is why? What other data points can we find that correlates to this increase?

Update: Could the baseball itself be the bigest variable in the home run rate? I think there's something to that. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8InFV3_AQc
